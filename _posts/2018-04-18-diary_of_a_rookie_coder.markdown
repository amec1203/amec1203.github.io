Full disclosure: this is my first time writing a personal blog post so if you have expectations, I hope they're low! I'm also only 2.5 weeks into coding school, attending part-time, so my experience and insights are limited. Not the best opener, I know, but *if there's one thing I've learned from coding so far, it's that it's okay to be honest about the challenges you face - in fact, you should embrace them.*

I'm at a place in my life where I am ready to take on a challenge. I've always been the tech savvy person amongst my friends and family, so naturally the computer was a good place to start. I first dabbled with code in my current job when I worked with a wonderful team at Thoughtworks to build a website. I loved the taste and wanted more. I then studied code to prepare for Flatiron's online program, and here I am now. Turns out Learn IDE, the open-source text editor that Flatiron uses, is really a portal to a new dimension!

When I started coding I thought the challenge was insurmountable. I didn't think I could complete, let alone excel at the program, and strongly considered dropping out. That sentiment has fizzled over the past week as I've allowed myself to let go of the pressures I cooked up in my head and am now taking it one day and one line of code at a time. I've learned believing in oneself goes a long way in overcoming a challenge. I know it's basic and something we've all heard before. But it didn't actually mean anything to me until now.

Coding allows you to build something that didn't exist before. You work hard at it, you problem solve, you struggle, you ask for help, and eventually you figure it out. There are painful moments but the feeling you get when you see your tests finally pass makes it all worth it. You can feel good about what you built, even if it's a simple game like tic tac toe. I always understood pride as something I felt towards other people, or in relation to some kind of big achievement, or having to do with identity. I'd be proud of a friend for finding the strength to leave a relationship they were unhappy in. Proud of my parents for finally getting ready to sell our childhood home. Proud of my girlfriend for following her dream of producing radio podcasts. Proud of my Lebanese and Sicilian heritages. Proud of myself for coming out despite the hardship that came with it. Now, I feel proud of myself every time a test in Ruby passes! It's a great feeling, and one I get to have every day.

Growth comes from stepping outside of one's comfort zone. It's much easier to do the things that aren't challenging, that come naturally to us. This is a principle that can be applied to all areas of life, but coding has opened my eyes to it.

I'll be curious to read this blog a year from now and laugh.
